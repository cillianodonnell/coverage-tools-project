RTEMS Tools Project

Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

The RTEMS Tools Project is a collection of tools to help you use RTEMS. The
package is self contained and if in a release package format is specific to an
RTEMS release and if in the git repo is a development version.

All tools are distributed as source code. They should work on a range of host
computers. Windows support may be via cross building on suitable Unix systems.

The tools contained in this package each come with documentation so please
locate and refer to that.

The RTEMS Tools Project has been developed for the RTEMS Project however these
tools can be used for a range of things not related to RTEMS. The RTEMS Project
welcomes this.

If you have a problem or question post to user@rtems.org or visit the RTEMS IRC
channel #rtems on chat.freenode.net. Drop by and tell us if you are using these
tools for other uses.

If you have any patches please post them to the devel@rtems.org mailing list in
git format patches with your details.
